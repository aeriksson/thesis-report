\chapter{An application to sequences}
\label{ch:time_series}

Recall that the optimisation problem is stated as
\[
    P^*_{opt} = \argmin_{P \in \mathcal{P}^*} \sum_{T_i \in \mathcal{T}} \epsilon^*(s(T_i), O^*(P, T_i)),
\]
where the objects that need to defined are the input and solution formats $[D]$ and $[S]$, the problem set $\mathcal{P}^*$, the test data $\mathcal{T}$, the error function $\epsilon^*$, and the oracle $O$. The framework presented in the previous chapter makes the assumption that all relevant problems $P$ can be decomposed into a set of functions $P = (T_D, F_E, C, F_R, M, \Sigma, T_S)$.

In this chapter, the objects mentioned above are defined for the two most common tasks in anomaly detection in sequences. Furthermore, suitable choices of and restrictions on $T_D$, $F_E$, $C$, $F_R$, $M$, $\Sigma$ and $T_S$ for anomaly detection are discussed in depth.

From here on, a \emph{sequence} will be taken to mean any list ($[X]$ for some set $X$) for which the list order reflects the natural ordering of the elements. A \emph{time series} is defined to be any sequence in $[(\mathbb{R}^+, X)]$, where the elements are ordered such that their first component (the timestamp) is increasing.

In Section~\ref{sect:tasks}, the two anomaly detection tasks we will study are presented. Corresponding oracles are presented.

The remaining sections consist of a discussion of how the components $T_D$, $F_E$, $C$, $F_R$, $M$, $\Sigma$, and $T_S$ relate to anomaly detection in sequences, and which component choices are appropriate.

\section{Tasks}
\label{sect:tasks}

Two main tasks can be distinguished in anomaly detection in sequences: \emph{finding anomalous sequences in a set of sequences}, and \emph{finding anomalous subsequences in a long sequence}~\cite{chandola}. The former task can be seen as the detection of point anomalies in an unstructured set of sequences, while the latter corresponds to finding contextual anomalies in a totally ordered set.

\subsection{Finding anomalous sequences}

The task of finding anomalous sequences in a set of sequences involves taking a list of similar sequences and producing a list of corresponding anomaly scores. The input elements are not related, i.e.\ the input data is unstructured. Thus, the task can be seen as one of detection of point anomalies in a collection of sequences. This task has been the subject of intense research. Thorough reviews are found in~\cite{chandola2} and~\cite{chandola3}.

For an example of this task, see figure \ref{fig:example1}. Here, dataset consists of a set of sequences of user commands extracted from a system log, and task corresponds to detecting individual anomalous sequences in this dataset. While sequences $\mathbf{S_1}$ through $\mathbf{S_4}$ are originate from ordinary user sessions, sequence $\mathbf{S_5}$ could indicate an attack. Accurately detecting such anomalous sequences is an important problem in computer security.

The input data has the format $[D]$, where $D$ is itself a set of sequences, i.e.\ $D = [X]$ for some set $X$. In the example above $X$ is a set of commands, but it could just as well be $\mathbb{R}$ or any other set. The solution format is $[S]$, where either $S = \mathbb{R}^+$ or $S = \{0, 1\}$ depending on the application requirements.

Since the input data is unstructured, any transformation $T_D$ must produce lists with the same length as it is given. Correspondingly, we can let $S' = S$. This renders $T_S$ redundant, so it can be ignored.

Since the task deals with unstructured data, the components $F_E$, $F_R$, and $\Sigma$ can be ignored. An oracle can then be formulated as:

\begin{algorithmic}
    \Require{Some $X \in [D]$.}
    \State{$X' \gets T_D(X)$}
    \State{$A \gets []$ \Comment{initialize anomaly scores to empty list}}
    \For{$E \in X'$} \Comment{iterate over elements}
        \State{$append(A, M(E, C(X', E)))$ \Comment{compute and store anomaly scores}}
    \EndFor{}
    \State{\Return{$A$ \Comment{aggregate scores to form anomaly vector}}}
\end{algorithmic}

As per the discussion in the previous chapter, $C$ can only be one of two functions, corresponding to unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection, respectively.

\subsection{Finding anomalous subsequences}

The task of finding anomalous subsequences of long sequences corresponds to finding anomalous contiguous sublists of the input data $[D]$. In contrast to the task of finding anomalous sequences, the input data is structured, and the sequence ordering naturally gives rise to concepts of proximity and context. This task is relatively poorly understood, but is highly relevant in many application domains. As a consequence, automated methods can be expected to be very useful for this task. Essentially any monitoring or diagnosis application could benefit from a better understanding of the task.

For examples of sequences to which this task might be applied, see Figures~\ref{fig:example2} and~\ref{fig:anomaly_types}. These are all real-valued sequences which contain anomalous items or subsequences.

As with the previous task, either $S = \mathbb{R}^+$ or $S = \{0, 1\}$ depending on the application. However, it here makes sense to allow $T_D$ to compress the data (i.e.\ return a shorter list than it is given). Correspondingly, a corresponding $T_S$ is required in order to transform the preliminary solution (in $[S']$) to a list of anomaly scores with the same length as the input data.

Since all components must be used for this task, the oracle is identical to the one presented in Section~\ref{sect:oracle}.

\section{The input data format \texorpdfstring{$\mathcal{D}$}{D}}

Categorical, discrete, and real-valued sequences have all been extensively studied. Categorical sequences arise naturally in applications such as bioinfomatics and intrusion detection. Discrete sequences are typically encountered when monitoring the frequency of events over time. Finally, real-valued sequences are encountered in any application that involves measuring physical phenomena (such as audio, video and other sensor-based applications).

Which the origins and nature of the data obviously differs heavily between these different categories of sequences, the choice of components (with the exception of the transformations and anomaly measures) can be made independently of the type of data. For this reason, we can disregard the data format in most of the following discussion.

\section{The transformations \texorpdfstring{$T_D$}{TD} and \texorpdfstring{$T_S$}{TS}}

\label{fig:types_of_data}

Transformations are commonly used to facilitate the analysis of sequences, and a large number of different such transformations are found in the literature. 

Feature extraction is commonly performed to reduce the dimensionality of sequences, and especially of real-valued ones. Essentially, the task of feature extraction in real-valued sequences corresponds to, given a sequence $s = [s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n]$, finding a collection of basis functions $[\phi_1, \phi_2, \dots, \phi_m]$ where $m < n$ that $s$ can be projected onto, such that $s$ can be recovered with little error. Many different methods for obtaining such bases have been proposed, including the discrete Fourier transform~\cite{faloutsos1}, discrete wavelet transforms~\cite{pong}~\cite{fu}, various piecewise linear and piecewise constant functions~\cite{keogh3}~\cite{geurts}, and singular value decomposition~\cite{keogh3}. An overview of different representations is provided in~\cite{fabian}.

Arguably the simplest of these bases are piecewise constant functions $[\phi_1, \phi_2, \dots, \phi_n]$:
\[
  \phi_i(t) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{l l}
      1 & \quad \text{ if } \tau_i < t < \tau_{i+1} \\
      0 & \quad \text{ otherwise.} \\
    \end{array} \right.
\]
where $(\tau_1, \tau_2, \dots \tau_n)$ is a partition of $[t_1, t_n]$.

Different piecewise constant representations have been proposed, corresponding to different partitions. The simplest of these, corresponding to a partition with constant $\tau_{i+1} - \tau_i$ is proposed in~\cite{keogh4} and~\cite{faloutsos2} and is usually referred to as \emph{piecewise aggregate approximation (PAA)}. As shown in~\cite{keogh5},~\cite{keogh3} and~\cite{faloutsos2}, PAA rivals the more sophisticated representations listed above.

Numerosity reduction is also commonly utilised in analysis of real-valued sequences. One scheme that combines numerosity and dimensionality reduction in order to give real-valued sequences into a categorical representation is \emph{symbolic aggregate approximation} (SAX)~\cite{sax}. This representation has been used to apply categorical anomaly measures to real-valued data with good results. A simplified variant of SAX is demonstraded in figure~\ref{fig:types_of_data}.

In general, real-valued sequences are much easier to deal with than time series. For this reason, irregular time series are commonly transformed to form regular time series, which can be treated as sequences. Formally, such transformations map a sequence in $[(\mathbb{R}^+, X)]$ to a sequence in $[X]$.

The simplest such transformation involves simply dropping the timestamp component of each item. This is useful when the order of items is important, but how far apart they are in time is not. This is often the case when dealing with categorical sequences. An example of such an application is shown in figure~\ref{fig:example1}.

Another common class of transformations involves estimating the (weighted) frequency of events. This is useful in many scenarios, especially in applications involving machine-generated data. Several methods can be used to generate sequences appropriate for this task from time series, such as histograms, sliding averages, etc.

% Given a time series $[(t_1, x_1), (t_2, x_2), \dots, (t_n, x_n)]$ in $[(\mathbb{R}^+, X)]$, with associated weights $w_i$ and some envelope function $e(s, t): X \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow X$, as well as a spacing and offset $\Delta, t_0 \in \mathbb{R}^+$, a sequence $[(s_{1}^{'}, \tau_1), (s_{2}^{'}, \tau_2), \dots]$ is constructed where $\tau_i = t_0 + \Delta \cdot i$ and $s_{i}^{'} = \sum_{(s_j, t_j) \in S} s_i w_i e(t_j - \tau_i)$.

% The $\tau_i$ can then be discarded and the time series treated as a sequence\footnote{Note that this method requires multiplication and addition to be defined for $X$, and is thus not applicable to most symbolic/categorical data. Also note that $\mathbf{s}'$ is really just a sequence of samples of the convolution $f_S \ast e$ where $f_S = \sum_i \delta(t_i) s_i w_i$.}. Histograms are recovered if $e(s, t) = 1$ when $|t| < \Delta/2$ and $e(x, t) = 0$ otherwise.

% How this aggregation is performed has a large and often poorly understood impact on the resulting sequence. As an example, when constructing histograms, the bin width and offset have implications for the speed and accuracy of the analysis. A small bin width leads to both small features and noise being more pronounced, while a large bin width might obscure smaller features. Similarly, the offset can greatly affect the appearance of the histograms, especially if the bin width is large. There is no `optimal' way to select these parameters, and various rules of thumb are typically used~\cite{density_estimation}.

% Furthermore, noisy data is often resampled to form regular time series. In this case, any of a number of resampling methods from the digital signal processing literature~\cite{TODO} may be employed.

% One commonly used transformation for real-valued data is the Z-normalization transform, which modifies a sequence to exhibit zero empirical mean and unit variance.\footnote{It has been argued that comparing time series is meaningless unless the Z-normalization transform is used~\cite{keogh5}. However, this is doubtful, as the transform masks sequences that are anomalous because they are displaced or scaled relative to other sequences.}

Transformations that transform the data into some alternative domain can also be useful. For example, transformations based on the \emph{discrete Fourier transform} (DFT) and \emph{discrete wavelet transform} (DWT)~\cite{fu} have shown promise. The DFT is parameter-free, while the DWT can be said to be parametrised due to the variety of possible wavelet transforms.

\section{The filters \texorpdfstring{$F_E$}{FE} and \texorpdfstring{$F_R$}{FR}}
\label{sect:filters}

As was previously mentioned, filters are really only interesting for the task of finding anomalous subsequences. Here, the role of the filter is to map a sequence in $[D']$ to a list candidate anomalies (subsequences of the input sequence).

By far the most frequently used filters are \emph{sliding window} filters. These map a sequence $X = [x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$ to
\[
    F_E(X) = [[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_w], [x_{s + 1}, x_{s + 2}, \dots, x_{s + w}], \dots, [x_{n - w}, x_{n - w + 1}, \dots, x_n]],
\]
where $w$ and $s$ are arbitrary integers (typically $s \leq w$)\footnote{We here assume that $s | n - w$. Otherwise, the last element above might look a bit different.}.

\section{The context function \texorpdfstring{$C$}{C}}
\label{sect:context}

The ordering present in sequences naturally give rise to a few interesting contexts, which are now demonstrated for a sequence $s = [s_1, s_2, \dots, s_n]$ and a candidate anomaly $s' [s_i, s_{i + 1}, \dots, s_j]$, where $1 \leq i \leq j \leq n$. It is here assumed that all candidate anomalies are contiguous. As mentioned in the previous chapter, contexts can be used to generalise the concept of training data. Semi-supervised anomaly detection corresponds to the \emph{semi-supervised context} $C(s, s') = T$, where $T$ is some fixed set of training data.

Likewise, traditional unsupervised anomaly detection for subsequences can be formulated using the \emph{trivial context} $C(s, s') = [[s_1, s_2, \dots, s_{i - 1}], [s_{j + 1}, s_{j + 2}, \dots, s_n]]$. This corresponds to finding either point anomalies or collective anomalies in a sequence.

Another interesting context is the \emph{novelty context} $C(s, s') = [[s_1, s_2, \dots, s_{i - 1}]]$. This context captures the task of novelty detection in sequences, which is especially interesting in monitoring applications.

Finally, a family of \emph{local contexts}
\[
    C(s, s') = [[s_{\max(1, i - a)}, s_{\max(2, i - a + 1)}, \dots, s_{i-1}], [s_{j+1}, s_{j+2}, \ldots s_{min(n, j+b)}]]
\]
may be defined for $a, b \in \mathbb{N}$, in order to handle anomalies such as the one in the last sequence of figure~\ref{fig:anomaly_types}.

\section{The anomaly measure \texorpdfstring{$M$}{M}}
\label{sect:anomeasure}

As was mentioned previously, an anomaly measure is a function $M: ([D'], [[D']]) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$ that takes a candidate anomaly $c \in [D']$ and a reference set $R \in [[D']]$, and produces an anomaly score based on how anomalous $C$ is with regards to $R$. A large number of such measures have been used in the literature, and a thorough discussion of these is not possible within the scope of this report. Instead, we will limit our consideration to distance-based anomaly measures, since these are flexible and have been shown to perform well in general for sequences~\cite{chandola3}.

Distance-based anomaly measures operate by, given some distance measure $\delta: [D'] \times [D'] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^+$, somehow aggregating the set $\{\delta(c, r) | r \in R\}$ into an anomaly score in $\mathbb{R}^+$. A class of especially interesting distance-based anomaly measure is k-nearest-neighbour-based anomaly measures. These assign as anomaly score the mean of the $k$ largest values of $\{\delta(c, r) | r \in R\}$.

Possible interesting choices of $\delta$ for real-valued data include the \emph{Euclidean distance} or the more general \emph{Minkowski distance}; measures focused on time series, such as \emph{dynamic time warping}~\cite{dtw}, \emph{autocorrelation measures}~\cite{autocorrelation}, or the \emph{Linear Predictive Coding cepstrum}~\cite{cepstrum}.

There are also several or measures developed for series of categorical data, such as the \emph{compression-based dissimilarity measure}~\cite{keogh2}. Often, coupling a distance measure with a data transformation step (in order to, for instance, to apply a distance measure defined on categorial data to a real-valued seqeuence) can yield good results.

\section{The aggregation function \texorpdfstring{$\Sigma$}{Sigma}}
\label{sect:aggregation_function_2}

Examples of anomaly detection problems which involve aggregation are hard to find in the literature. For this reason, suggesting appropriate choices of $\Sigma$ is difficult. A few choices which are likely to produce good results are $\Sigma$ on the form suggested in Section~\ref{sect:aggregation_function}, with $\sigma$ that produce either the \emph{maximum}, \emph{minimum}, \emph{median}, or \emph{mean} of its input values. The resulting $\Sigma$ will henceforth be referred to as $\Sigma_{max}$, $\Sigma_{min}$, $\Sigma_{median}$ and $\Sigma_{mean}$, respectively.
